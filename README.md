#### Tips:
When you install or delete every tile there's a default tile with 1 item that automatically gets added

Right click the extension icon and go to "Options" to add, remove and move tiles and items

You can also move tiles in the popup

#### Roadmap (lol):
I'm planning to add a color picker and editable url fields at some point maybe but working with dialogs is so much simpler for now that i didn't bother
