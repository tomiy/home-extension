#### Tips:
When you install, or if you delete every tile, there's a default tile with 1 item that automatically gets added

Right click the extension icon and go to "Options" to add, remove and move tiles and items
Right click sections and items to open action menus

You can also move tiles in the popup

#### Roadmap:
* More cutsomizable items => colors?
* Small tutorial (because right click menus aren't always obvious)
* Reorder items in section
* Move items from section to section
